# Responsive Web Layout V4

This is the fourth version of the responsive web layout project. In this version, I have made further improvements to the design and functionality, focusing on user experience, performance optimization, and accessibility.

## Description

The previous versions (V1, V2, and V3) introduced basic layouts, advanced responsiveness, and interactive features like JavaScript-driven dropdown menus and modals. **In version 4**, the layout has been further refined with additional features and optimizations:

- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced file sizes, improved load times, and optimized images.
- **Advanced CSS Techniques**: Utilized advanced CSS features like custom properties (CSS variables) for better maintainability.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: More comprehensive accessibility features, including better focus management and improved semantic HTML.
- **Mobile-first approach**: The design now follows a mobile-first approach, ensuring the best user experience on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

## New Features in Version 4
